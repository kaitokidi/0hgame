0h game jam
===========

I started this project on October 26th 2014 at 02:00am, and finished it on October 26th 2014 at 02:00am
Amazing isn't it? a game made with no time? yup! enjoy it!
(for those who are asceptical about it, http://0hgame.eu/)


The rules: 

	1- no one talk about fight club

	2- DO NOT TOUCH BLACK THINGS IF YOU DONT WANT TO START AGAIN

	3- try to reach the other side of the window to window

	4- Enjoy it. (it is a rule, so if you are not enjoying the game is because you are not following the rules)


I made the game using this existing project as base : https://github.com/kaitokidi/ViewExample

To use it, you will need SFML libs, on Ubuntu 14 they are already included on the packages, in other Operating sistems, you will need to install them
For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) 
for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .
