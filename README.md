I made the game using this existing project as base : https://github.com/kaitokidi/ViewExample

To use it, you will need SFML libs, on Ubuntu 14 they are already included on the packages, in other Operating sistems, you will need to install them
For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) 
for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .
